# Project-LifeBox
The objective of the project is to design a container that is fully capable of accommodating a human heart during organ transportation and also capable of maintaining the vitality of the organ for a minimum duration of 6 hours.

The requirement of the design was to create a system that would:
1. To precisely monitor the temperature of the organ, to be transported and monitor the temperature of chamber, where the cardioplegic solution is placed
2. Control the temperature of the system biased on the feedback from the temperature sensors
3. Precisely deliver prescribed amount of cardioplegic solution to the organ at fixed intervals
4. Monitor the pressure of the inflow during deliver of the cardioplegic solution to the organ
5. Monitor the pH of drained solution from the organ
6. Monitor the remaining amounts of refrigerant and preservation solution left
7. Monitor any mechanical shocks absorbed by the system during organ transportation
8. Integrate an energy system that can support the functionalities of the system for 12 Hours
9. And finally, Create a Control Interface which will be used to monitor feedback from the system and control functionalities of the system.
